Technologies that can be used for Competitive Data Search Engine

- Talked to the service team and got the ways we can go about this
- Solr service used currenlty is not much aligning with our use-case
- It’d be better to use new instance of service
- It’ll involve setting up everything from scratch
- One way would be to setup everything on local machine and see if it’s all working then use Solr service at a host?
- Also, if Solr service needs to be instantiated again, we can use elasticsearch bcz of it’s less complexity
- elasticsearch also gives extra tools
- Going back to first point, if competitive listings are indeed indexed in the same Solr service then, 
  it will lead to expansion of resources of the existing service and might incur some cost
- So again, ig cost will be incurred both ways
