Competitive Data Dashboard III - 20/06

Some data that is mapped to the same listing is there. I fetched data for both. 
The logic of data retrieval is changed now and it’s giving data for each listing as an object and all the catalog data mapped to it in a list.
MRP will be the same for all competitors right? If not, which MRP to pick up?
MOQ should be of udaan right?
Currently, the next step is to fetch udaan prices but I’m having a little problem with that.
City’s filter is working right.
Almost 4 seconds for 15 listings. 
The whole code is now migrated to first-party-pricing.
The endpoint made to monitor some beforehand chosen listings is changed to
	/pricing/competitive/listings
There are some doubts from my side of how to extract excel data and send it to first-party-pricing. Should it be like a POST request?
Right now, querying needs optimization, it could be made surely much faster
Currently the data is returned in the form:
