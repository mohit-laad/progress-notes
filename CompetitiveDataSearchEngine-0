Competitive Data Search Engine I - 06/07

  Requirement is to build a search engine on the second screen of the Competitive Data Section on the First Party Console. 
  We do not have any instance of elasticsearch currently.
  The idea is to use search technology to give all the listings mapped to competitors by using value entered in the search bar. 
  There are 13397 listingIds mapped to competitors’ catalogIds. 
  The search bar will have(in future) some filters like vertical, city, etc beside it.
  The Solr service used in udaan-search can be used with some slight modifications/conditions:
  The search service doesn’t have SKU title as a field so SKU can’t be used for querying. Instead, if possible, listing titles can be used for the same purpose(?)
  By searching with, say coca cola, search service will give all the listingIds having title or generated_title with some match score, these listingIds will be fed to find out competitiveData.
  The API that can potentially be used:
