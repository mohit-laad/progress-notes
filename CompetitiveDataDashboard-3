Competitive Data Dashboard IV - 23/06

Allowed file formats are .xls and .xlsx as library used to parse data is XSSFWorkbook
Excel file takes one column of listingIDs as input and after uploading the file, data is fetched from  first-party’s CompetitiveClient 
The Udaan’s price fetched is priceInPaisa.basicPrice.onCODBasePrice
Earlier, I was using two endpoints, they are combined into one POST request now.
OOS appended for listings Out Of Stock = true and Sales Unit ID removed.
Empty positions are replaced by “-” in the table and can be changed by changing the variable symbol in the render part.
Also, data from a previous file uploaded in the same session can also be viewed if the file isn’t deleted manually.
The endpoint made to monitor some beforehand chosen listings is changed to, where city is a query parameter and city = ALL means no city filter.
	/pricing/competitive/listings?city=ALL POST request with body
Currently the data is returned in the form:
